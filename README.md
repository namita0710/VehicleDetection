Project Description
Vehicle Detection App is a real-time application that uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect vehicles in images or live video streams. The app is built using OpenCV for image processing  for object detection. It can be used in various scenarios such as traffic monitoring, surveillance, and autonomous vehicle systems to identify and track vehicles in dynamic environments.

Features:
Real-time Vehicle Detection: Detect vehicles in live video feeds.
Image Detection: Identify vehicles in static images.
Multiple Vehicle Types: Recognize different types of vehicles (for Now we have built it for cars).
User-friendly Interface: Simple UI to upload images or use live camera feed.
Efficient and Accurate: Built with state-of-the-art object detection models.
Tech Stack:
Python: Primary programming language for the app.
OpenCV: Image processing library used to handle video feeds and display images.
Flask/Django (Optional): For building a web interface (if the app is extended for web use).

# Vehicle Detection App

The **Vehicle Detection App** is a real-time application that detects vehicles in images or video streams. Built using computer vision techniques and deep learning models, this app can detect various types of vehicles such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles (for Now we have built it for cars) in dynamic environments.

## Features
- **Real-time Vehicle Detection:** Detect vehicles in live video feeds.
- **Image-Based Vehicle Detection:** Upload and analyze images to identify vehicles.
- **Multiple Vehicle Types:** Detect and classify different vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles)(for Now we have built it for cars).
- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** Simple UI for easy interaction.

## Requirements

To run the Vehicle Detection App, you will need the following:

- Python 3.9
- OpenCV
- Flask (if you are using the web interface)
